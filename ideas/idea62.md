Imagine a stylish jacket that seamlessly adapts to your surroundings and mood, enhancing your personal style while incorporating smart features. The Chameleon Jacket is designed with a unique fabric that can change color and pattern through embedded tiny micro-LEDs and thermochromic materials, reacting to both environmental stimuli and user preferences.
