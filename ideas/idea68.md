   - **Mental Challenge**: A group discussion or activity focusing on overcoming mental barriers, sharing strategies, and supporting one another.

4. **Nutrition & Recovery Workshops**:
   - Monthly sessions on nutrition tailored to individual needs, focusing on whole foods, hydration, and recovery strategies.
